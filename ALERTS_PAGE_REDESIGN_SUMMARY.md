# Alerts Page Redesign Summary

## Overview
Completely redesigned the Alerts page to be more modern, space-efficient, and user-friendly while removing unnecessary information like model details.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Compact Timeline Design**
- Replaced large cards with a compact timeline view
- Implemented color-coded left borders for visual hierarchy:
  - Urgent: Red (with subtle red background)
  - High: Orange  
  - Medium: Yellow
  - Low: Blue
- Reduced vertical spacing by ~60%

### 2. **Smart Information Display**
- **Removed model information** from metadata display
- Intelligent metadata formatting (no raw JSON)
- Inline badges for level, type, and time
- Expandable details only when needed
- Filtered out any model-related metadata fields

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Design**
- Added hover effects with subtle background changes
- Smooth transitions for all interactions
- Quick action buttons (external link) appear on hover
- Consistent with the system's modern aesthetic

### 4. **Better Information Density**
- Shows 3-4x more alerts per screen
- Grouped alerts by time periods (Today, Yesterday, This Week, Older)
- Added filtering options for level and type
- Compact header with alert statistics

### 5. **New Features Added**
- **Alert Statistics**: Visual indicators showing count by level
- **Filtering System**: Filter by alert level and type
- **Time Grouping**: Automatic grouping by recency
- **Expandable Details**: Click to view metadata without cluttering the view
