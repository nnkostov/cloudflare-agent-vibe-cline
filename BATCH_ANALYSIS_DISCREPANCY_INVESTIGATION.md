# Batch Analysis Discrepancy Investigation

## Current Status (as of 10:35 AM PST)

### API Reports (Batch ID: batch_1753118774070)
- **Status**: Running
- **Completed**: 23 repositories
- **Failed**: 2 repositories
- **Total**: 30 repositories
- **Current Repository**: microsoft/tensorwatch
- **Progress**: 76.7% complete

### UI Reports
- **Completed**: 8 repositories
- **Failed**: 4 repositories

## Discrepancy Analysis

### Possible Causes:

1. **Different Batch IDs**
   - The UI might be displaying a different batch than the one we're tracking via API
   - A new batch might have been triggered with a different ID

2. **Browser Caching**
   - The browser might be caching old API responses
   - React state might not be updating properly despite the 3-second polling interval

3. **Backend/Frontend Sync Issues**
   - There might be a delay in data propagation
   - The UI might be reading from a different data source

4. **Error Tracking Differences**
   - The backend might be counting failures differently than the UI
   - Some analyses might have partial failures not reflected in the API

## Recommendations

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache and cookies for the site

2. **Check Batch ID**
   - Verify the batch ID shown in the UI matches `batch_1753118774070`
   - The batch ID should be visible in the browser's network tab

3. **Check Console Errors**
   - Open browser developer tools and check for any JavaScript errors
   - Look for failed API calls in the Network tab

4. **Verify Latest Deployment**
   - Ensure you're accessing the latest deployed version
   - The version should be v2.0.40

## Actual Batch Progress

Based on the API, the batch analysis is working correctly:
- ✅ Claude 4 integration is functioning
- ✅ Analyses are being completed successfully (23/30 done)
- ✅ Only 2 failures out of 25 attempts (92% success rate)
- ✅ System is processing ~1 repository every 20-25 seconds

The batch should complete in approximately 2-3 minutes.
