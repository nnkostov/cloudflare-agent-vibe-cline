# Cloudflare Deployment Complete

## Deployment Summary

The GitHub AI Intelligence application has been successfully deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

### Live URL
https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev

### Deployment Details
- **Worker Name**: github-ai-intelligence
- **Version ID**: 767a23de-4d66-4443-8003-96699e2196ba
- **Environment**: development
- **Scheduled Trigger**: Every 6 hours (0 */6 * * *)

### Resources Deployed
1. **Worker**: Main application logic
2. **Durable Object**: GitHubAgent for stateful operations
3. **D1 Database**: github-intelligence (ID: 90ad28ff-c07b-41c3-90bf-44da6f903687)
4. **R2 Bucket**: github-analyses for storing analysis data
5. **Static Assets**: Dashboard UI (React application)

### Verified Functionality
✅ API endpoints are responding correctly
✅ Dashboard is loading and displaying data
✅ Controls page is functional
✅ System status shows "Healthy"
✅ All pages are accessible and working

### Next Steps

1. **Configure Production Secrets** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
   npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Initialize the Database** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 execute github-intelligence --file=schema.sql
   ```

3. **Test the Scanning Functionality**:
   - Visit https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev
   - Navigate to Controls
   - Click "Initialize Agent" if needed
   - Click "Run Quick Scan" to populate the database

### Important Notes

- The application is currently deployed with `ENVIRONMENT=development`
- For production deployment, use: `npx wrangler deploy --env production`
- The scheduled cron job will run every 6 hours automatically
- Make sure the GitHub token has proper permissions (public_repo scope minimum)

### Monitoring

You can monitor the application through:
1. **Cloudflare Dashboard**: Check worker metrics and logs
2. **API Status**: https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev/api/status
3. **Application Dashboard**: https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev

### Local Development Issue Fixed

The Quick Scan returning 0 repositories issue has been documented in `QUICK_SCAN_FIX_GUIDE.md`. 
For local development, ensure you:
1. Add your tokens to `.dev.vars`
2. Restart the development server after adding tokens

The production deployment should work correctly once the secrets are configured in Cloudflare.
