# Production Database Setup Complete

## Summary

Successfully set up the production database for the GitHub AI Intelligence Agent system. The database is now fully operational with sample data, and the production deployment is working correctly.

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Schema Creation
- Created all necessary tables in the remote D1 database:
  - `repositories` - Stores GitHub repository information
  - `repo_metrics` - Tracks repository metrics over time
  - `analyses` - Stores AI analysis results
  - `alerts` - System alerts and notifications
  - `contributors` - Repository contributor information
  - `trends` - Detected trends in the ecosystem
- Created performance indexes for all tables

### 2. Sample Data Import
- Imported 5 trending repositories:
  - Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT (177k stars)
  - AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui (155k stars)
  - n8n-io/n8n (118k stars)
  - langchain-ai/langchain (112k stars)
  - langgenius/dify (107k stars)
- Added 1 sample analysis for LangChain
- Created 2 sample alerts
- Added 2 trending topics

### 3. Local Database Setup
- Also set up the local database with the same schema and data for development consistency

### 4. Deployment Verification
- Redeployed the worker to ensure it picks up the database changes
- Worker is now live at: https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev

## Verification Results

✅ **Dashboard Overview Page**: Working correctly, showing:
- System Status: Healthy
- Monitored Repos: 0 (expected for fresh setup)
- Trending Repos: 5
- Active Alerts: 2
- Repository Tiers: All at 0 (no repos have been tiered yet)

✅ **Leaderboard Page**: Displaying all 5 trending repositories with proper formatting

✅ **Alerts Page**: Showing both alerts with details

✅ **API Endpoints**: All working correctly
- `/api/status` - System status
- `/api/repos/trending` - Returns 5 repositories
- `/api/alerts` - Returns 2 alerts
- `/api/reports/enhanced` - Returns system report

## Important Notes

### About the Vite Proxy Configuration
The `dashboard/vite.config.ts` file contains a proxy configuration that redirects `/api` to `localhost:8787` during development. This is **only active during local development** when running `npm run dev`. 

In production:
- The dashboard uses relative paths (`/api`)
- These resolve to the same domain where the dashboard is hosted
- No localhost redirects occur in production
- The API and dashboard are served from the same Cloudflare Worker

### Production URLs
- Dashboard: https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev
- API Base: https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev/api

### Database IDs
- Database Name: `github-intelligence`
- Database ID: `90ad28ff-c07b-41c3-90bf-44da6f903687`

## Next Steps

1. **Run a comprehensive scan** to populate the database with more repositories:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev/api/scan/comprehensive
   ```

2. **Monitor the cron job** - It's configured to run every 6 hours to scan for new repositories

3. **Check the Controls page** in the dashboard to manually trigger scans or analyses

The system is now fully operational and ready for use!
