# Leaderboard UX Improvement - Complete Success! 🎉

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
The Leaderboard interface lacked clarity about what each tab represented, causing user confusion:
- **"All" tab**: Unclear what selection criteria was used (trending vs. all repositories)
- **Tier tabs**: No explanation of what each tier meant or their significance

- **Missing counts**: No indication of how many repositories were in each category

## 🎯 **Solution Implemented**
