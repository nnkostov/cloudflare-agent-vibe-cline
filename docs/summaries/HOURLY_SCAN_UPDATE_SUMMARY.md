# Hourly Scan Update Summary

## Date: January 15, 2025

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Scan Interval to 1 Hour**
   - Modified `src/types/index.ts`:
     - Changed `scanInterval` from 6 hours to 1 hour
     - Changed `hot` tier `scanFrequency` from 6 hours to 1 hour
   - Modified `wrangler.toml`:
     - Changed cron schedule from `"0 */6 * * *"` (every 6 hours) to `"0 * * * *"` (every hour)

2. **Enhanced Quick Scan with Tier Assignment**
   - Updated `src/agents/GitHubAgent-unified.ts`:
     - Added tier assignment logic to the `scanGitHub` method
     - Now calculates growth velocity and assigns initial tiers to all discovered repos
     - This ensures repos are properly categorized for the comprehensive scan

3. **Fixed Comprehensive Scan Timeout Issues**
   - Modified comprehensive scan to prevent CPU time limit errors:
     - Added 45-second max runtime limit
     - Limited batch sizes: Tier 1 (10 repos), Tier 2 (20 repos), Tier 3 (30 repos)
     - Added time checks to stop processing before hitting limits
     - Returns processed count for monitoring

4. **Increased Quick Scan Repository Limit**
   - Modified `src/services/github-unified.ts`:
     - Changed default `limit` parameter in `searchTrendingRepos` from 30 to 100
     - Now discovers up to 100 repositories per scan (GitHub API maximum per page)
     - This means 100 new trending AI repos discovered every hour instead of just 30

### How It Works Now

1. **Every Hour (Cron Schedule)**:
   - Quick Scan runs automatically
   - Discovers up to 100 new repos and assigns them to tiers
   - Basic metrics are saved

2. **Comprehensive Scan** (manual or scheduled):
   - Processes existing repos based on their tier
   - Tier 1: Deep analysis with all metrics
   - Tier 2: Basic metrics (stars, issues)
   - Tier 3: Minimal updates
   - Stops before hitting CPU limits

### Benefits

- More frequent discovery of trending repos (every hour)
- 3x more repos discovered per scan (100 vs 30)
- Better tier management for efficient processing
- No more timeout errors during comprehensive scans
- Scalable approach that can handle thousands of repos

### Deployment

To deploy these changes:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

The cron job will automatically start running every hour after deployment.

### Monitoring
