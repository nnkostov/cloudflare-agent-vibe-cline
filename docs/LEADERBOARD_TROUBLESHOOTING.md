# Leaderboard View Analysis Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ The fix has been applied to the code
- ✅ The API is returning the correct data structure with both `name` and `owner` fields
- ✅ The dashboard has been built and deployed
- ❌ The issue persists in the browser

## Code Verification

### API Response (Confirmed Working)
```json
{
  "id": "45717250",
  "name": "tensorflow",
  "owner": "tensorflow",
  "full_name": "tensorflow/tensorflow",
  ...
}
```

### Frontend Fix (Already Applied)
```typescript
const [owner, name] = repo.full_name.split('/');
return (
  <Link
    to={`/analysis/${owner}/${name}`}
    className="..."
  >
    View Analysis
  </Link>
);
```

## Possible Causes

### 1. Browser Cache
The browser might be serving the old JavaScript bundle from cache.

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Open in incognito/private window

### 2. Cloudflare CDN Cache
Cloudflare might be caching the old assets at the edge.

**Solution:**
- Go to Cloudflare dashboard
- Navigate to Caching → Configuration
- Click "Purge Everything" or purge specific URLs

### 3. Service Worker Cache
If there's a service worker, it might be intercepting requests.

**Solution:**
- Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Click "Unregister" for any service workers
- Clear storage

### 4. Wrong Deployment URL
Make sure you're accessing the correct URL:
- Production: https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev
- NOT: https://github-ai-intelligence.pages.dev (this one is not working)

## Verification Steps

1. **Check the deployed version:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Refresh the page
   - Look for the main JavaScript file (index-*.js)
   - Click on it and check the Response tab
   - Search for "repo.full_name.split" - it should be there

2. **Check API response:**
   - In DevTools Network tab
   - Look for the `/api/repos/trending` request
   - Check the response to confirm it has `name` and `owner` fields

3. **Check console for errors:**
   - Look for any JavaScript errors in the console
   - Check if there are any failed network requests

## Quick Fix Script

Run the provided `clear-cache-and-deploy.bat` script which will:
1. Rebuild the dashboard
2. Deploy to Cloudflare
3. Provide instructions for clearing cache

## Manual Cache Clearing

### Chrome/Edge:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"

### Firefox:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Select "Cache"
3. Click "Clear Now"

### Safari:
1. Develop menu → Empty Caches
2. Or Cmd+Option+E

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check if you're on the right URL**: https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev
2. **Inspect the actual code being served**:
   - View page source
   - Search for the JavaScript file
   - Open it and search for "split" to see if the fix is there
3. **Check for JavaScript errors** in the console
4. **Try a different browser** to rule out browser-specific issues
