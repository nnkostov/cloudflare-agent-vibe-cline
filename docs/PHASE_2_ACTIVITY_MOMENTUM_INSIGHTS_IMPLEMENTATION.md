# Phase 2: Activity & Momentum Insights Implementation Summary

## Feature Implemented
Added comprehensive Activity & Momentum Insights to the Enhanced Report, providing real-time visibility into repository activity patterns, community health, AI use cases, and growth momentum.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (src/index.ts)

**1. Most Active Repositories Query**
- Fetches top 5 repositories by recent push date
- Includes contributor count from repo_metrics
- Calculates fork-to-star ratio
- Shows hours since last update

**2. AI Use Case Categorization**
- SQL-based topic analysis using CASE statements
- Categories: Code/Dev Tools, Chatbots, Data/Analytics, Generation, General AI
- Percentage distribution calculation

**3. Momentum Indicators**
- Growth-based categorization:
  - 🚀 Accelerating: >20% growth/month
  - 📈 Growing: 5-20% growth/month
  - ➡️ Steady: 0-5% growth/month
  - 📉 Cooling: <0% growth/month
- Uses historical repo_metrics data

**4. Community Health Metrics**
- Team size categorization:
  - 🌟 Large Teams: 50+ contributors
  - 👥 Growing Teams: 10-50 contributors
  - 🚀 Small Teams: <10 contributors
- Based on max contributors from repo_metrics

### Frontend Changes (dashboard/src/pages/Reports.tsx)

**1. Most Active Repositories Section**
- Clean list view with activity metrics
- Shows update time, contributors, fork ratio, issues
- Numbered ranking

**2. Community Health Grid**
- Three-column layout with counts
- Visual icons and descriptions
- Clear team size thresholds

**3. AI Use Cases Bar Charts**
- Horizontal progress bars
- Percentage labels
- Smooth animations
- Category-based grouping

**4. Momentum Status Cards**
- Color-coded cards (green/blue/gray/orange)
- Emoji indicators
- Count displays
- Grid layout for all momentum states

### API Type Updates (dashboard/src/lib/api.ts)
- Added complete `activity_insights` type definition
- Properly typed all sub-components
- Maintained backward compatibility
