# Quick Scan 100 Repositories Fix Summary

## Date: January 16, 2025

### Problem
The Quick Scan was still only discovering 20-32 repositories instead of the intended 100, even though we had updated the limit in the unified service files.

### Root Cause
The issue was that `src/index.ts` was importing the original `GitHubAgent` from `./agents/GitHubAgent` instead of the updated unified version from `./agents/GitHubAgent-unified` that contains our 100 repository limit changes.

### Solution
1. Updated the import in `src/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from:
   export { GitHubAgent } from './agents/GitHubAgent';
   
   // To:
   export { GitHubAgent } from './agents/GitHubAgent-unified';
   ```

2. Deployed the changes to Cloudflare Workers

### Files Modified
- `src/index.ts` - Updated to use the unified GitHubAgent with 100 repo limit
- Renamed `src/index.ts` to `src/index-old.ts` as backup
- Created new `src/index.ts` with correct import

### Result
âœ… Quick Scan now uses the unified GitHubAgent that:
- Has the 100 repository limit in `searchTrendingRepos`
- Includes tier assignment logic
- Properly calculates growth velocity for all discovered repos

### Verification
After deployment, the Quick Scan should now discover up to 100 repositories per scan instead of just 20-32.
