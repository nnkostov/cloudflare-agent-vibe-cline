# Trending Repos Error Fix Summary

## Date: January 18, 2025

### Issue Identified

The `/repos/trending` endpoint was throwing a 500 error (Worker threw exception) when trying to display trending repositories on both the Overview and Leaderboard pages.

### Root Cause

The error was caused by the `parseRepositoryWithTier` method in `src/services/storage-unified.ts` trying to parse the `topics` field with `JSON.parse()` when it was already an array in some cases. This happened because:

1. When data comes directly from the database, the `topics` field is stored as a JSON string
2. However, in complex queries with JOINs or when data is processed through multiple layers, the `topics` field might already be parsed into an array
3. Attempting to `JSON.parse()` an array throws a TypeError

### Solution Implemented

Added a type check in both `parseRepository` and `parseRepositoryWithTier` methods to handle both cases:

```typescript
// Before:
topics: JSON.parse(row.topics || '[]'),

// After:
topics: Array.isArray(row.topics) ? row.topics : JSON.parse(row.topics || '[]'),
```

This ensures that:
- If `topics` is already an array, it's used as-is
- If `topics` is a string (JSON), it's parsed
- If `topics` is null/undefined, it defaults to an empty array

### Files Modified

- `src/services/storage-unified.ts`
  - Updated `parseRepository` method
  - Updated `parseRepositoryWithTier` method

### Deployment Status

âœ… Successfully deployed to production at 12:52 AM PST

### Verification Steps

1. Navigate to https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev/
2. Check that the Overview page loads without errors
3. Navigate to the Leaderboard page
4. Verify that trending repositories are displayed correctly
5. Run a comprehensive scan to ensure the system continues to function properly

### Impact

This fix ensures that:
- The trending repositories endpoint works reliably
- Both Overview and Leaderboard pages display data correctly
- The system handles different data formats gracefully
- No more 500 errors when accessing trending repository data
