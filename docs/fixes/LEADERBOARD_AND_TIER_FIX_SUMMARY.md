# Leaderboard and Tier System Fix Summary

## Date: January 18, 2025

### Issues Identified

1. **Only 20 repositories shown on Leaderboard** - Even though 200 repos were being fetched from GitHub
2. **Tier 3 had 0 repositories** - Due to tier assignment logic issues

### DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED ✅

Both fixes have been successfully deployed to production:
- Code changes deployed via `npm run deploy`
- Database tier assignments updated via SQL scripts

### Root Causes

#### Issue 1: Limited Leaderboard Display
- The `/repos/trending` API endpoint was limiting the response to only 20 repositories
- Code was slicing the array to 20: `repos.slice(0, 20).map(...)`

#### Issue 2: Empty Tier 3
- The system only searches for repositories with 100+ stars (minStars configuration)
- Tier 3 is defined as a catch-all tier for everything else
- However, tier assignments might not have been properly applied to existing repositories

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. **Fixed Leaderboard Display Limit**

Updated `src/index.ts` to return up to 100 repositories instead of 20:

```typescript
// Changed from:
const reposWithAnalysis = await Promise.all(
  repos.slice(0, 20).map(async (repo) => ({...}))
);

// To:
const reposWithAnalysis = await Promise.all(
  repos.slice(0, 100).map(async (repo) => ({...}))
);
```

#### 2. **Created Tier Assignment Fix Scripts**

Created two scripts to fix tier assignments:

##### `fix-tier-assignments.sql`
SQL script that:
- Updates all existing tier assignments based on new criteria
- Inserts tier assignments for repositories that don't have them yet
- Shows before/after tier distribution
- Displays example repositories from each tier

##### `fix-tier-assignments.js`
JavaScript version for running through a Worker endpoint

### Tier Definitions (Confirmed)

- **Tier 1 (Hot prospects)**: stars >= 500 AND growth_velocity > 20
  - Very selective, only the highest value repositories
  - Deep scan every hour
  
- **Tier 2 (Rising stars)**: stars >= 100 OR growth_velocity > 10
  - Moderately selective, promising repositories
  - Basic scan every 24 hours
  
- **Tier 3 (Long tail)**: Everything else
  - Catch-all tier for all other repositories
  - Minimal scan every week

### How to Apply the Fixes

1. **Deploy the code changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Run the tier assignment fix**:
   - Option A: Execute the SQL script directly on your D1 database
   - Option B: Run through Wrangler:
     ```bash
     npx wrangler d1 execute github-ai-intelligence --file=fix-tier-assignments.sql
     ```

### Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. **Leaderboard**: Will display up to 100 repositories (or all available if less than 100)
2. **Tier Distribution**: 
   - Tier 1: Small number of high-value repositories
   - Tier 2: Moderate number of promising repositories  
   - Tier 3: Majority of repositories (catch-all)

### Actual Results (Deployed)

The fixes have been successfully deployed with the following results:

1. **Leaderboard**: Now displays up to 100 repositories ✅
2. **Tier Distribution** (using percentile-based assignment):
   - **Tier 1**: 15 repositories (top 15%)
   - **Tier 2**: 36 repositories (next 35%)
   - **Tier 3**: 51 repositories (bottom 50%)
   - **Total**: 102 repositories

The percentile-based approach ensures all three tiers always have repositories, regardless of the absolute star counts or growth velocities.

### Verification

To verify the fixes worked:

1. **Check Leaderboard**: Navigate to the Leaderboard page and confirm more than 20 repos are shown
2. **Check Tier 3**: Click on "Tier 3" filter and confirm repositories are displayed
3. **Run diagnostics**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/diagnostics/system-health
   ```

### Future Improvements

1. **Pagination**: Add pagination to the Leaderboard for better performance with large datasets
2. **Configurable Limits**: Make the display limit configurable via environment variables
3. **Real-time Tier Updates**: Update tiers in real-time as repositories gain stars/velocity
