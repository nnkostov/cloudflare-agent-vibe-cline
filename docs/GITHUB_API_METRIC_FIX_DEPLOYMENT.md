# GitHub API Metric Fix Deployment Summary

## Deployment Details
- **Date**: July 21, 2025
- **Version**: v2.0.43
- **Worker URL**: https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev
- **Deployment ID**: e5137f9d-1faf-4161-9177-47fdb67ec49a

## What Was Fixed

### The Issue
- GitHub API metric was showing "10 remaining" which was from our internal rate limiter (30 requests/minute)
- This was confusing as GitHub actually allows 5000 requests/hour for authenticated requests

### The Fix
- Modified `/api-metrics` endpoint to calculate GitHub remaining based on actual GitHub limits
- Now shows: `remaining = 5000 - calls_today` instead of using internal rate limiter tokens

### Code Changes
In `src/index.ts`:
```javascript
// Before: Using internal rate limiter
remaining: rateLimits.github.availableTokens,

// After: Using actual GitHub API limit
const githubHourlyLimit = 5000;
const githubRemaining = Math.max(0, githubHourlyLimit - callsToday.github);
```

## Live Behavior

### GitHub API Metric Now Shows:
- **"0 calls (5000 remaining)"** = No GitHub API calls today, full 5000 hourly limit available
- **"156 calls (4844 remaining)"** = 156 calls made, 4844 remaining from 5000 limit
- **"5000 calls (0 remaining)"** = Hit the hourly limit (unlikely in practice)

### Other Metrics Unchanged:
- **Claude API**: Still shows analyses count and token usage
- **Search API**: Still uses internal rate limiter (10/minute limit)

## Why This Matters
1. **Accuracy**: Shows real GitHub API availability, not artificial limits
2. **Transparency**: Users see actual API capacity for planning
3. **Consistency**: Aligns with GitHub's documented rate limits

## Verification
1. Visit https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev
2. Go to Controls page
3. Check Neural Activity Command Center
4. GitHub API should show remaining based on 5000/hour limit

## Technical Notes
- No database changes required
- Backward compatible
- Search API still uses rate limiter as it has stricter limits
- Claude API shows token usage instead of remaining (no hard limit)
