# API Nexus Activity Display Fix - Deployment Summary

## Deployment Details
- **Version**: v2.0.41
- **Deployed At**: 2025-07-21T19:23:22Z
- **Deployment URL**: https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev
- **Worker Version ID**: f74eca2c-41bc-4c3b-b11b-99d9b41deb0a

## Changes Deployed

### 1. Neural Activity Command Center (Controls Page)
- Fixed API Nexus showing 0% for all APIs
- Integrated worker metrics for real-time activity data
- Enhanced display with meaningful status indicators

### 2. System Activity Sidebar (All Pages)
- Applied same fix to sidebar API metric
- Ensured consistency across the entire UI
- Added activity source indicators in tooltips

## Key Improvements
- **Real-time Activity**: Both displays now show actual system activity based on worker metrics
- **Better UX**: Shows "Ready" instead of "0%" when APIs are idle
- **Dynamic Updates**: Activity levels refresh every 10 seconds
- **Consistency**: Both components use identical calculation logic

## Verification Steps
1. Visit the dashboard at https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev
2. Check the System Activity sidebar - API metric should show meaningful values
3. Navigate to Controls page
4. Verify the Neural Activity Command Center shows consistent API activity
5. Trigger a scan to see real-time updates

## Technical Details
- Added `workerMetrics` query to both components
- Enhanced activity calculations to use multiple data sources
- Improved tooltips to show data source (real-time metrics vs rate limits)
- Maintained backward compatibility with rate limit data as fallback

The fix is now live and users will see accurate API activity levels across the dashboard.
