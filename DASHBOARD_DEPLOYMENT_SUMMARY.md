- Real-time data fetching with React Query

### 2. **Leaderboard Page**
- Repository rankings with tier filtering
- Investment scores and recommendations
- Language indicators and topic tags
- Direct links to GitHub and analysis pages

### 3. **Alerts Page**
- Real-time alert monitoring
- Alert level indicators (urgent, high, medium, low)
- Filtering by alert type and level
- Detailed alert metadata display

### 4. **Reports Page**
- Daily investment reports
- Enhanced tiered reports
- System metrics and performance data
- High-growth repository tracking

### 5. **Controls Page**
- Agent initialization
- Quick scan for trending repos
- Comprehensive tiered scanning
- Rate limit monitoring
- System information display

### 6. **Analysis Page** (Route configured)
- Individual repository analysis view
- Detailed metrics and insights

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **React Router** for navigation
- **React Query** for data fetching and caching
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons

### API Integration
- RESTful API client with proper error handling
- CORS-enabled endpoints
- Automatic retries and caching
- Development proxy configuration

## Deployment Details

### Worker API Updates
- Added CORS headers to all API endpoints
- Updated BaseService to include CORS in responses
- Deployed to: `https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev`

### Dashboard Deployment
- **Platform**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Project Name**: github-ai-intelligence
- **Build Output**: `dashboard/dist`
- **Production URL**: `https://github-ai-intelligence.pages.dev`
- **Preview URL**: `https://c4997441.github-ai-intelligence.pages.dev`

### Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd dashboard && npm install

# Development server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=github-ai-intelligence
```

## Current Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Dashboard UI fully functional
- ✅ API integration with CORS support
- ✅ Real-time data fetching
- ✅ All pages implemented and styled
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Error handling and loading states

### Known Issues
- DNS propagation may take time for the production URL
- SSL certificate provisioning in progress for preview URLs
- No data displayed until agent is initialized and scans are run

## Next Steps

1. **Initialize the Agent**
   - Use the Controls page to initialize the agent
   - Run a comprehensive scan to populate data

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check rate limits on the Controls page
   - Review system metrics in Reports

3. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - Add a custom domain in Cloudflare Pages settings
   - Update DNS records as needed

## Environment Variables
The dashboard uses environment-based API URLs:
- Development: Proxies to `/api` (configured in Vite)
- Production: Direct API calls to `https://github-ai-intelligence.nkostov.workers.dev/api`

## Security Considerations
- CORS configured to allow all origins (consider restricting in production)
- API keys are stored as Worker secrets, not exposed to frontend
- All API calls use HTTPS in production

## Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates recommended
- Monitor Cloudflare Pages build logs for deployment issues
- Check Worker logs for API errors
- Use React Query DevTools in development for debugging

## Conclusion
The dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for managing the GitHub AI Intelligence Agent system. All core features are implemented and the system is ready for production use once DNS propagation completes and initial data is populated through agent scans.
