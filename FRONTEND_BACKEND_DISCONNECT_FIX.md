# Frontend-Backend Disconnect Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Data Structure Mismatches
- **Problem**: Frontend expected `name` and `owner` fields separately, but backend wasn't consistently providing them
- **Solution**: Updated `StorageUnifiedService` to ensure all repository objects include both fields from the database

### 2. Missing Tier Information
- **Problem**: Leaderboard tried to display tier badges but repos didn't have tier information
- **Solution**: Modified queries to LEFT JOIN with `repo_tiers` table and include tier in response

### 3. Analysis Data Format Issues
- **Problem**: Frontend expected flat structure (e.g., `investment_score`) but backend returned nested structure (`scores.investment`)
- **Solution**: Created `parseAnalysisForFrontend()` method to transform analysis data to match frontend expectations

### 4. Field Name Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: 
  - Frontend: `analyzed_at` vs Backend: `created_at`
  - Frontend: `model_used` vs Backend: `model`
  - Frontend: `key_questions` vs Backend: `questions`
- **Solution**: Mapped fields correctly in the parsing method

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Unified Storage Service (`src/services/storage-unified.ts`)
- Combines functionality from multiple storage services
- Includes tier information in all repository queries
- Provides consistent data formatting for frontend consumption
- Exports alias for backward compatibility

### 2. Updated Main Index (`src/index.ts`)
- Replaced `StorageServiceFixed` with `StorageUnifiedService` in:
  - `handleRepoCount()`
  - `handleTrendingRepos()`
  - `handleReposByTier()`

### 3. Data Transformation Methods
- `parseRepositoryWithTier()`: Includes tier information with repository data
- `parseAnalysisForFrontend()`: Transforms analysis data to match frontend structure

## API Response Structure

### Repository Object
```json
{
  "id": "12345",
  "name": "tensorflow",
  "owner": "tensorflow",
  "full_name": "tensorflow/tensorflow",
  "description": "...",
  "stars": 180000,
  "forks": 88000,
  "language": "C++",
  "topics": ["machine-learning", "tensorflow"],
  "tier": 1,
  "latest_analysis": { ... }
}
```

### Analysis Object
```json
{
  "repo_id": "12345",
  "investment_score": 85,
  "innovation_score": 90,
  "team_score": 80,
  "market_score": 88,
  "recommendation": "strong-buy",
  "summary": "...",
  "strengths": ["..."],
  "risks": ["..."],
  "key_questions": ["..."],
  "model_used": "claude-opus-4",
  "analyzed_at": "2025-01-16T..."
}
```

## Testing

Created `test-api-structure.js` to verify:
1. Repository objects have all required fields
2. Analysis data is properly formatted
3. Tier information is included
4. All endpoints return expected structure

## Deployment Steps

1. Build the dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

2. Deploy to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. Clear browser cache and test

## Verification

After deployment:
1. Check `/api/repos/trending` returns repos with `name`, `owner`, and `tier`
2. Verify analysis data has flat structure with `investment_score`, etc.
3. Confirm Leaderboard displays without errors
4. Test tier filtering works correctly

## Frontend Benefits

- No more `full_name.split('/')` workarounds
- Tier badges display correctly
- Analysis page receives data in expected format
- All field names match between frontend and backend
